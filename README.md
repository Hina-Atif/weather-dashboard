### Weather Dashboard with DevOps Practices  ###

This is a Weather Dashboard web application built using Flask, Docker, AWS EC2, and Prometheus for monitoring.
The project demonstrates modern DevOps practices such as containerization, cloud deployment, and application monitoring.
The app provides real-time weather data and is deployed in a cloud environment for production use.  

#### Project Overview ####
The Weather Dashboard project is a web application that provides weather information for a specified city. 
The weather data is retrieved and displayed on the dashboard. The app is containerized with Docker, deployed to AWS EC2, and includes a Prometheus monitoring setup. 
The project highlights key DevOps practices such as automation, containerization, cloud deployment, and monitoring.

### Technologies Used ####
Flask: Lightweight Python web framework to build the web application.
Docker: Containerization platform to package the application and dependencies.
AWS EC2: Cloud infrastructure for deploying and hosting the application.
Prometheus: Open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit to monitor application metrics.
GitHub: Version control and source code hosting.

### Features ####
Weather Data: Displays real-time weather information for a given city.
Flask Application: Built using the Flask framework to serve as the backend.
Dockerized App: The app is fully containerized for easy deployment and portability.
Prometheus Monitoring: Exposes a /metrics endpoint for Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Flask app.
Cloud Deployment: Deployed to AWS EC2 for cloud-based hosting and production readiness.
Scalable Infrastructure: Ready to be scaled and enhanced with additional DevOps tools.

### Setup and Installation ####
*** Prerequisites ****
Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools installed:

Python 3.x: Required for Flask.
Docker: Required for containerization.
AWS Account: For deploying the application to EC2.

### git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-dashboard.git
cd weather-dashboard ****

### Install Dependencies ###
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
*** python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate` **************

### Install the required Python packages: ####
****** pip install -r requirements.txt *********

#### Dockerize the Application ####
Create a Docker image for the Flask application:
***** docker build -t weather-dashboard .  ************

#### Running the Application ##########
 Run Flask Application
To run the application locally, use the following command:
******* docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name weather-dashboard weather-dashboard *********

#### Now #####
the Flask application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000 

####### Access the Weather Dashboard #########
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to view the weather dashboard.

#### Cloud Deployment #####
The application is deployed on AWS EC2 for production use. To replicate the deployment:

Set up an EC2 Instance with an Ubuntu image.
Install Docker on the instance.
Clone the repository and build the Docker image on the EC2 instance.
Expose the app to the internet using AWS Security Groups (allowing traffic on port 5000).

### You can access the app ####
via the public IP of your EC2 instance at http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:5000
